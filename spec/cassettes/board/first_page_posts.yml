        i dont know if it needs a specific copy of osx mavericks either.<br><br>But
        yeah, I need to get a mac for editing on Final Cut, Media Composer, and Pro

        I wish the pride parades would stop. When people see these dudes in thongs
        on a float, they get the wrong idea about the gay community.<\/span><br><br>Literally
        this. The gay community is &quot;othered&quot; so strongly because half of
        them are consciously trying to other themselves through shit like this so
        they can be viewed as giving the establishment the finger. This directly contradicts
        the majority of modern gays who have a message of &quot;we&#039;re just like
        you but are interested in the same sex, please let us marry&quot;. Too bad
        for them their fore runners fucked everything up for them starting in the
        60s and 70s or else there would probably have been a constitutional amendment
        for gay marriage.","time":1398886773,"resto":41667175},{"no":41673467,"now":"04\/30\/14(Wed)15:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a
