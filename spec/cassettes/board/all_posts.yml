        i dont know if it needs a specific copy of osx mavericks either.<br><br>But
        yeah, I need to get a mac for editing on Final Cut, Media Composer, and Pro

        I wish the pride parades would stop. When people see these dudes in thongs
        on a float, they get the wrong idea about the gay community.<\/span><br><br>Literally
        this. The gay community is &quot;othered&quot; so strongly because half of
        them are consciously trying to other themselves through shit like this so
        they can be viewed as giving the establishment the finger. This directly contradicts
        the majority of modern gays who have a message of &quot;we&#039;re just like
        you but are interested in the same sex, please let us marry&quot;. Too bad
        for them their fore runners fucked everything up for them starting in the
        60s and 70s or else there would probably have been a constitutional amendment
        for gay marriage.","time":1398886773,"resto":41667175},{"no":41673467,"now":"04\/30\/14(Wed)15:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        here bud, I&#039;m almost 49 years old. I&#039;ve been using computers since
        the original Apple 1 was in stores. In high school I used a multi-user BASIC
        system running on a Data General Nova minicomputer connected to 3 schools
        via 300bps modems over leased phone lines. The first computer I built was
        based on a 1976 Popular Electronics article and used an old Teletype ASR-33
        as a terminal. The next three computers were S-100 bus systems running CP\/M
        v2.2. Depending on your age, I may have been writing code in C under CP\/M
        before you were even *born*. I&#039;ve owned no-name Taiwaneese knock-off
        XT clone motherboard-based systems I built on the cheap, with monochrome (yes,
        the ugly-ass green-screen) graphics. I remember the original Mac looking like
        someone&#039;s idea of a joke to me. I thought Windows v2.x was the most useless
        thing on the planet. I actually ran IBM&#039;s OS\/2 for a couple *years*
        and thought it was awesome. The only reason I changed from Win95 was because
        the USB support was virtually non-existent. The only reason I changed from
        Win98SE to Win2k was it wasn&#039;t stable on a CPU running over ~800MHz.
        I had an entire WinNT4 domain, complete with PDC, running in my apartment,
        while I was getting an MCSE.","time":1398897561,"resto":41675892},{"no":41676245,"now":"04\/30\/14(Wed)18:39:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        patterns in it. I imagine since each platter is small, this would best be
        done with a large number of platters, or with other glass or sand mixed in.

        A year and a half ago I ended up getting the Spirit One after several hours
        of listening to many different semi-portable headphones within that price
        range. I fucking loved the sound sig, even if compared to brighter stuff they&#039;re
        virtually veiled. The Spirit Pro and Classic improved on that both comfort
        and sound-wise. I use the Spirit Pro pretty much for any genre except classical.
        Classics sounded the same to me, though they&#039;re built a bit nicer.<br><br>T70\/T90:
        Sharp and bright. I&#039;m not a neutralfag even if I can appreciate it to
        some degree. The sound felt very detailed to me, and I&#039;ve yet to try
        on comfier headphones than the home stuff from Beyerdynamic. Different to
        most other headphones I&#039;ve listened, but not in a bad way. Just don&#039;t
        turn the volume way up.<br><br>P7: Just go and read some reviews. I haven&#039;t
        listened to them, but they&#039;re getting a lot of praise.<br><br>HD650:
        Safe choice. They sound detailed and relaxed. Too much lower mids for me though.
        Makes the sound... thick in a way.<br><br>HE-400i: Hifiman&#039;s HE-500 is
        awesome, and I hope they learned from their mistakes with the HE-400. If they
        did and made the sound sig more akin to the HE-500 the revised 400i could
        be a great headphone.","time":1398804275,"resto":41654949},{"no":41655706,"now":"04\/29\/14(Tue)16:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        not without impedance.  Balun impedances are usually at least 75 ohms which

        which is 95% of the revenue for 98% of movies. On the 18th day, these movies
        will be available everywhere ubiquitously and you will pay for the size. A
        movie screen will be $15. A 75\u201d TV will be $4.00. A smartphone will be
        $1.99. That enterprise that will exist throughout the world, when that happens,

        remain silent will cause more trouble for you than it&#039;s worth in many
        cases. If the police just want to ask you a question (eg. why are you in this
        park after curfew) you are just starting trouble by remaining silent and making

        battery off of one charge, and it ends up charging in like 45 minutes, so
        that&#039;s not a problem. The case\/bands included and the fuckload of watchfaces
        to choose from on the app store make it so you can have a watch that looks
        like a normal, regular one. That&#039;s kind of boring, however. I tend to
        prefer the faces that display the time in ways that are still nice and classy,

        eventually work for me after some frustration. The locker app is neat. Or,
        well, it&#039;s kind of another problem with the watch. The 8 app\/watchface
        limit is entirely fucking abitrary because there are some apps that contain
        8 or more watchfaces and just let you cycle through them. It&#039;s not really
        a big problem because the whole locker system works well, but it just bothers

        was one of my dorfs charged headlong at a pack of about 6 mounted goblin cavalry,
        and started trying to beat them to death with his crossbow. The goblins were
        intimidated as fuck by his display of batshit insanity, so they broke and
        ran. He chased those filthy green fucks around the map for about almost a
        season of in game time before I decided it was time to end shit, and sent

        cool thing about the E6400 series is the &quot;rubber feet&quot; on the bottom.
        Because so many people who get business class laptops are on the go constantly
        and the rubber feet on most laptops - even business class models - are just
        pieces of cut\/formed rubber with some glue holding them in place, they get
        lost or simply rubbed off due to use and being mobile.<br><br>The rubber feet
        on the E6400 are specially made: it&#039;s rubber that surrounds an internal
        piece of ABS plastic very tightly and the ABS plastic has pins in it that
        insert into the magnesium bottom chassis on the laptop incredibly tight.<br><br>You
        couldn&#039;t pull the feet off an E6400 with your fingers, couldn&#039;t
        pry them off with your fingernails - you literally have to use a damned flat
        edge screwdriver or something similar to pry under the rubber aspect and then
        apply considerable force to get the damned things to come off.<br><br>Just
        another thing that makes the E6400 so fucking awesome.<br><br>I swear, if

        In some cases the JIT compiler can optimize certain pieces of code after it
        has been executed many times. The advantage of bytecode is that the code can
        be specifically optimized for a given architecture (x86, ARM, etc). In some
        rare cases these optimizations might result in better performance than the
        equivalent C++ code, but it depends on implementation. If you really wanted

        most important points are the following:<br><br>Runtime statistics - because
        JIT compilation is done at runtime, it can gather statistics while the program
        is executing which enable better optimisations (e.g. knowing the probability
        that a particular branch is taken). This can enable Java JIT compilers to
        produce better code than C\/C++ compilers (which have to &quot;guess&quot;
        the most likely branch in advance, an assumption which may often be wrong).<br><br>Better
        platform targetting - by delaying compilation to application start-up (JIT
        compilation etc.) the Java compiler can take advantage of the fact that it
        knows the exact processor it is executing on. This can enable some very beneficial
        optimisations that you wouldn&#039;t be able to do in pre-compiled C\/C++
        code that needs to target a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; processor
        instruction set.<br><br>although Java classes are stored as bytecode, this
        is (usually) compiled to native code by the JIT compiler as the program starts
        up. Once compiled, it is pure native code - so theoretically it can be expected
        to perform just as well as compiled C\/C++ once the program has been running
        for long enough (i.e. after all the JIT compilation has been done)","time":1398868386,"resto":41667945},{"no":41669027,"now":"04\/30\/14(Wed)10:34:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        CDs and DVDs I have, some of which are game discs. The problem is that my
        backups never pass CRC checks. Usually, the biggest problem is in the audio
        tracks and any video files found on the discs.<br><br>Now, I&#039;ve used
        various types of software ranging from CloneCD to ImgBurn. I made sure to
        configure them to read the discs at the lowest possible speed, and to cancel
        the operation if any read errors were encountered. Regardless, the CRCs never
        match up.<br><br>Is there any particular (Windows) software I need to consider
        for this operation, or am I just doing something wrong?<br><br>Uh, pic not
        related.","filename":"tumblr_m1x8znqNYe1rnonmho1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1398885226627,"time":1398885226,"md5":"PH3hyF6Pcd8p+dVYr3cFwQ==","fsize":23411,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"making-accurate-backups-of-data-discs","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":41674386,"now":"04\/30\/14(Wed)16:38:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a
