        long did your initial foray into programming last? Mine was a short expedition
        with C++ about five years ago, less than a month in duration, then I departed
        again with Python about two years later, this time going for just over a month.
        Currently voyaging with C, have been for three months approaching 5 hours
        a day. The reason for the failure of my first two ventures I conjecture is
        that I set out with the intention of learning to program rather than trying
        to build something, meaning forcible consumption of material that started
        quite dry and became quickly anhydrous.
