        dissatisfaction thread.<br><br>Recently I installed Debian.  I&#039;ve been
        a winfag most of my life.  I installed Jessie instead of going full bleeding
        edge.  It was easy enough for a babby to install, but soon the fact that it&#039;s
        a pile of shit became apparent:<br><br>-It didn&#039;t have multi-architechture
        package support by default, I had to enable that in bash myself just to install
        half of the shit I need.  <br><br>-WPA supplicant is the biggest pile of shit
        I&#039;ve ever used to connect to the internet, it scans for dhcp offers for
        about a fucking hour before I can boot.  <br><br>-Debian Jessie comes with
        Emacs 23, which doesn&#039;t come with package.el.  Instead of installing
        that on its own I decided to upgrade to Emacs 24.  That broke my Emacs installation,
        so I tried deleting all traces of Emacs to install Emacs 24 without conflicts.  I
        deleted my Emacs directories and then Emacs wouldn&#039;t install.  So I created
        those directories, and I still couldn&#039;t install as root because I didn&#039;t
        have permission to access the folders I just made.  Now there&#039;s no text
        editor other than Nano and shitty Vi.  <br><br>-Then I tried installing roundcube,
        the mysql database didn&#039;t automatically configure properly and now roundcube
        doesn&#039;t work, and nothing else can be installed.  Using any package manager
        I&#039;m told to manually run &#039;dpkg --configure -a&#039; to correct my
        problem.  I have, and it didn&#039;t work, I don&#039;t even have a package
        manager now.  Debian has naturally fucked itself so horribly, I&#039;m probably
        going to backup, format, and install something else.  I&#039;ve used Arch
        before and it was easy as fuck, none of this retarded bullshit ever happened.  Fuck

        a nonshit website that a business relied on in a few weeks.<br><br>So I broke
        down and used wordpress. It still took me a pretty long time and a lot of
        frustrated days and nights knocking around trying to make it look OK. In the

        \/g\/ i seem to be having issues with a rig and would like your help in confirming
        what part ill need to replace. thanks in advance, ive been working for a long
        time now with these issues. current issues with the rig:<br><br>vent\/skype\/streaming,
        there is a big static buzzing\/hissing sound. i have confirmed its not the
        mic, as the mic works buzz-free on my tablet. the buzzing starts whenever
        a game loads up or im in one.<br><br>randomly at times my internet (not a
        wireless connection) will cut out and die, which leads to my system slowing
        down and eventually BSOD&#039;ing. this also happens during high impact\/stress
        situations on the rig, such as during titanfall\/bf4\/other games<br><br>if
        i awake from sleep mode on my system, my internal hdd is not found and i have
        to disconnect and reconnect the sata cable for it to detect it again. There
        are no issues with this hdd after reconnecting it this way. if i place my
        3rd hdd (which i believe was dying and ive disconnected) windows lags out
        and bsod. it will then tell me nothing is found as a bootable device after
        post (windows is not on that drive, though, its installed on my ssd). changing
        any sata ports on the motherboard or using different sata cables does not
        solve any of these issues.<br><br>my mobo (p8z68 asus pro gen 3) wont hold
        any multiplier on my cpu (i5 3570k). it just reverts it to 34 on my bios whenever
        its changed. it was a handmedown from a friend so i dont know if its always
        had this issue or not.<br><br>With all these issues I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s
        the motherboard or the psu. I don&#039;t have the money to replace both yet
        and rather not sit around to wait for one of them to completely go out and
        take another component of my system with it. im not too sure how to be 100%
        sure which component is going out. my psu power might look fine, but it also
        might be unstable power and causing these issues. or it could just be my motherboard
        slowly shorting out.","filename":"1361655257600","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1333,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1399047566836,"time":1399047566,"md5":"PjI7xG1+nQ08b09\/Wn\/emA==","fsize":430790,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-g-i-seem-to-be-having-issues-with-a-rig-and","replies":3,"images":0,"last_replies":[{"no":41705436,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)12:41:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        is encouraging owners to go out on the town this Saturday night wearing their
        high-tech glasses. To some, a bar full of Glass wearers might sound like the
        Worst Saturday Night Ever, but the hope is the cyborg masses will be able
