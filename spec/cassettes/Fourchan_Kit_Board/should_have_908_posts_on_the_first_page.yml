        dissatisfaction thread.<br><br>Recently I installed Debian.  I&#039;ve been
        a winfag most of my life.  I installed Jessie instead of going full bleeding
        edge.  It was easy enough for a babby to install, but soon the fact that it&#039;s
        a pile of shit became apparent:<br><br>-It didn&#039;t have multi-architechture
        package support by default, I had to enable that in bash myself just to install
        half of the shit I need.  <br><br>-WPA supplicant is the biggest pile of shit
        I&#039;ve ever used to connect to the internet, it scans for dhcp offers for
        about a fucking hour before I can boot.  <br><br>-Debian Jessie comes with
        Emacs 23, which doesn&#039;t come with package.el.  Instead of installing
        that on its own I decided to upgrade to Emacs 24.  That broke my Emacs installation,
        so I tried deleting all traces of Emacs to install Emacs 24 without conflicts.  I
        deleted my Emacs directories and then Emacs wouldn&#039;t install.  So I created
        those directories, and I still couldn&#039;t install as root because I didn&#039;t
        have permission to access the folders I just made.  Now there&#039;s no text
        editor other than Nano and shitty Vi.  <br><br>-Then I tried installing roundcube,
        the mysql database didn&#039;t automatically configure properly and now roundcube
        doesn&#039;t work, and nothing else can be installed.  Using any package manager
        I&#039;m told to manually run &#039;dpkg --configure -a&#039; to correct my
        problem.  I have, and it didn&#039;t work, I don&#039;t even have a package
        manager now.  Debian has naturally fucked itself so horribly, I&#039;m probably
        going to backup, format, and install something else.  I&#039;ve used Arch
        before and it was easy as fuck, none of this retarded bullshit ever happened.  Fuck
        Debian, it&#039;s a huge pile of dogshit.<br><br>Seriously, a distro shouldn&#039;t
        be so god damn easy to fuck up.  Arch and I had zero problems.  I&#039;m generally
        new to Linux and Debian shouldn&#039;t be such a huge easy to mangle pile
        of shit.  It&#039;s destroyed itself within three months of use.  Way to go,
        Debian dev faggots.","filename":"fuck8","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":441,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":179,"tim":1399047200691,"time":1399047200,"md5":"nXYQdoeGPMzYHSlMUdXEVg==","fsize":46732,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ganoolinucks-dissatisfaction-thread-recently-i","replies":101,"images":9,"omitted_posts":96,"omitted_images":9,"last_replies":[{"no":41706421,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)13:50:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        months ago I was given the opportunity to &quot;fix&quot; my company&#039;s
        website. It was pure shit so I figured I could do better and the owners offered
        me a bonus if I could fix it on the cheap. I first downloaded Adobe&#039;s
        creative suite and banged around in photoshop and dreamweaver for a week or
        two. In that time I realized I was not going to go from zero to scratch building
        a nonshit website that a business relied on in a few weeks.<br><br>So I broke
        down and used wordpress. It still took me a pretty long time and a lot of
        frustrated days and nights knocking around trying to make it look OK. In the
        end I think I did a pretty decent job. Everyone at my company is happy and
        I learned a lot.<br><br>A lot of people go to our website and I have had a
        few people at other small and medium size businesses ask me if I could &quot;fix&quot;
        or &quot;do&quot; their websites. They don&#039;t know I&#039;m a hack and
        only know wordpress. I have had to go mess with the html and css to make things
        look the way I want but I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m doing.<br><br>I
        think maybe I could do this for a living or at least part time on the side
        for cash... what can I do now to learn? Take a college class?<br><br>I have
        made some shitty sample sites in dreamweaver and followed some tutorials but
        I never feel like I learn anything. And it&#039;s hard to make a &quot;responsive&quot;

        \/g\/ i seem to be having issues with a rig and would like your help in confirming
        what part ill need to replace. thanks in advance, ive been working for a long
        time now with these issues. current issues with the rig:<br><br>vent\/skype\/streaming,
        there is a big static buzzing\/hissing sound. i have confirmed its not the
        mic, as the mic works buzz-free on my tablet. the buzzing starts whenever
        a game loads up or im in one.<br><br>randomly at times my internet (not a
        wireless connection) will cut out and die, which leads to my system slowing
        down and eventually BSOD&#039;ing. this also happens during high impact\/stress
        situations on the rig, such as during titanfall\/bf4\/other games<br><br>if
        i awake from sleep mode on my system, my internal hdd is not found and i have
        to disconnect and reconnect the sata cable for it to detect it again. There
        are no issues with this hdd after reconnecting it this way. if i place my
        3rd hdd (which i believe was dying and ive disconnected) windows lags out
        and bsod. it will then tell me nothing is found as a bootable device after
        post (windows is not on that drive, though, its installed on my ssd). changing
        any sata ports on the motherboard or using different sata cables does not
        solve any of these issues.<br><br>my mobo (p8z68 asus pro gen 3) wont hold
        any multiplier on my cpu (i5 3570k). it just reverts it to 34 on my bios whenever
        its changed. it was a handmedown from a friend so i dont know if its always
        had this issue or not.<br><br>With all these issues I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s
        the motherboard or the psu. I don&#039;t have the money to replace both yet
        and rather not sit around to wait for one of them to completely go out and
        take another component of my system with it. im not too sure how to be 100%
        sure which component is going out. my psu power might look fine, but it also
        might be unstable power and causing these issues. or it could just be my motherboard
        slowly shorting out.","filename":"1361655257600","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1333,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1399047566836,"time":1399047566,"md5":"PjI7xG1+nQ08b09\/Wn\/emA==","fsize":430790,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-g-i-seem-to-be-having-issues-with-a-rig-and","replies":3,"images":0,"last_replies":[{"no":41705436,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)12:41:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        in bars where other patrons think mistakenly think Explorers are recording
        their every move (or they actually are). To help improve that image, Google
        is encouraging owners to go out on the town this Saturday night wearing their
        high-tech glasses. To some, a bar full of Glass wearers might sound like the
        Worst Saturday Night Ever, but the hope is the cyborg masses will be able
        to educate the public a little better than when they&#039;re flying solo.
        The #GlassNightOut also offers the opportunity to mix and mingle with other
        Explorers -- a rare experience if you&#039;re living somewhere outside of
        San Francisco, and probably a lot more fun than going on Field Trip by your
        lonesome. If you&#039;re interested in checking out one of the Meetups this

        larger ball, which you can&#039;t have in a thumb ball for obvious reasons.
        I still enjoy having most of my hand completely static though. Generally I
        use my trackball on a soft surface and not always flush with the ground. I
        think thumb ball is simply a better fit for my use case but I&#039;m open
        to change. What would you recommend? I value smooth movement above all else
        and usually achieve accuracy by a flick\/stop\/hold maneuver (also just flicking
        works wonderfully with Gnome 3&#039;s hot corner).","time":1399045093,"resto":41704185},{"no":41704791,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)11:49:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        desperate here, 4 minutes until it&#039;s due<br><br><br>These are the full
        instructions:<br>&quot;First, define a class definition for a java integer.
        A java integer has an integer field for the <br>original order it was created
        and an integer field for a random number. It will have a constructor <br>that
        initializes both fields to argument values sent to it. It will have separate
        get methods for the <br>two integer fields. It will be \u201cis a\u201d Comparable
        and will override the abstract method and will <br>compare java integers by
        the value in the random integer field. <br> <br>Second, create a main class.
        You will prompt the user to ask them the number of java integer <br>nodes
        in your linked list. You will then use a loop to get (for each node) a random
        number <br>between 1 and 150, create a java integer object, and put it in
        the linked list. <br> <br>You will then sort the random java integers in your
        linked list. This will rearrange the java <br>integers, but each will retain
        its original order data field integer. You will then use a list iterator <br>to
        traverse the linked list to print out the index number, the original order
        integer field, and the <br>random integer number field for each of the nodes.
        Use centered column headings for the three <br>fields, and use field widths
        to line up on the right the three columns of numbers centered under <br>the
        column headings. <br> <br>You will then repeat the traversing with the list
        iterator, but this time sum up the random integer <br>field. You will then
        calculate and print the labeled sum, mean (average to 2 decimal places), <br>range
        (difference between highest and lowest random integer fields), median (middle
        random <br>integer value), and a random java integer from a random spot from
        your linked list of random <br>number (get a random index number for your
        linked list with random(), then look up the java <br>integer at that spot
        in your linked list and print both data fields) - all without using your input
        <br>how many variable, but using linked list methods.&quot;","filename":"templ3","ext":".png","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1399038499934,"time":1399038499,"md5":"f3Zg+Do8llaAVXQ9acERkA==","fsize":104065,"resto":41698428},{"no":41703370,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)09:48:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        of two integers 4 and 2 is 2. The greatest common divisor of two integers
        16 and 24 is 8. How do you find the greatest common divisor? Let the two input
        integers be n1 and n2. You know that number 1 is a common divisor, but it
        may not be the greatest common divisor. So you can check whether k (for k
        = 2, 3, 4 and so on) is a common divisor for n1 and n2, until k is greater
        than n1 or n2. Store the common divisor in a variable named gcd. Initially,
        gcd is 1. Whenever a new common divisor is found, it becomes the new gcd.
        When you have checked all the possible common divisors from 2 up to n1 or
        n2, the value in variable gcd is the greatest common divisor. The idea can
        be translated into the following loop:<br><br>int gcd = 1;<br>int k = 1;<br><br>while
