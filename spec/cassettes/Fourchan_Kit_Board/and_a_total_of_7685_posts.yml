        dissatisfaction thread.<br><br>Recently I installed Debian.  I&#039;ve been
        a winfag most of my life.  I installed Jessie instead of going full bleeding
        edge.  It was easy enough for a babby to install, but soon the fact that it&#039;s
        a pile of shit became apparent:<br><br>-It didn&#039;t have multi-architechture
        package support by default, I had to enable that in bash myself just to install
        half of the shit I need.  <br><br>-WPA supplicant is the biggest pile of shit
        I&#039;ve ever used to connect to the internet, it scans for dhcp offers for
        about a fucking hour before I can boot.  <br><br>-Debian Jessie comes with
        Emacs 23, which doesn&#039;t come with package.el.  Instead of installing
        that on its own I decided to upgrade to Emacs 24.  That broke my Emacs installation,
        so I tried deleting all traces of Emacs to install Emacs 24 without conflicts.  I
        deleted my Emacs directories and then Emacs wouldn&#039;t install.  So I created
        those directories, and I still couldn&#039;t install as root because I didn&#039;t
        have permission to access the folders I just made.  Now there&#039;s no text
        editor other than Nano and shitty Vi.  <br><br>-Then I tried installing roundcube,
        the mysql database didn&#039;t automatically configure properly and now roundcube
        doesn&#039;t work, and nothing else can be installed.  Using any package manager
        I&#039;m told to manually run &#039;dpkg --configure -a&#039; to correct my
        problem.  I have, and it didn&#039;t work, I don&#039;t even have a package
        manager now.  Debian has naturally fucked itself so horribly, I&#039;m probably
        going to backup, format, and install something else.  I&#039;ve used Arch
        before and it was easy as fuck, none of this retarded bullshit ever happened.  Fuck
        Debian, it&#039;s a huge pile of dogshit.<br><br>Seriously, a distro shouldn&#039;t
        be so god damn easy to fuck up.  Arch and I had zero problems.  I&#039;m generally
        new to Linux and Debian shouldn&#039;t be such a huge easy to mangle pile
        of shit.  It&#039;s destroyed itself within three months of use.  Way to go,
        Debian dev faggots.","filename":"fuck8","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":441,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":179,"tim":1399047200691,"time":1399047200,"md5":"nXYQdoeGPMzYHSlMUdXEVg==","fsize":46732,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ganoolinucks-dissatisfaction-thread-recently-i","replies":101,"images":9,"omitted_posts":96,"omitted_images":9,"last_replies":[{"no":41706421,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)13:50:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        months ago I was given the opportunity to &quot;fix&quot; my company&#039;s
        website. It was pure shit so I figured I could do better and the owners offered
        me a bonus if I could fix it on the cheap. I first downloaded Adobe&#039;s
        creative suite and banged around in photoshop and dreamweaver for a week or
        two. In that time I realized I was not going to go from zero to scratch building
        a nonshit website that a business relied on in a few weeks.<br><br>So I broke
        down and used wordpress. It still took me a pretty long time and a lot of
        frustrated days and nights knocking around trying to make it look OK. In the
        end I think I did a pretty decent job. Everyone at my company is happy and
        I learned a lot.<br><br>A lot of people go to our website and I have had a
        few people at other small and medium size businesses ask me if I could &quot;fix&quot;
        or &quot;do&quot; their websites. They don&#039;t know I&#039;m a hack and
        only know wordpress. I have had to go mess with the html and css to make things
        look the way I want but I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m doing.<br><br>I
        think maybe I could do this for a living or at least part time on the side
        for cash... what can I do now to learn? Take a college class?<br><br>I have
        made some shitty sample sites in dreamweaver and followed some tutorials but
        I never feel like I learn anything. And it&#039;s hard to make a &quot;responsive&quot;

        \/g\/ i seem to be having issues with a rig and would like your help in confirming
        what part ill need to replace. thanks in advance, ive been working for a long
        time now with these issues. current issues with the rig:<br><br>vent\/skype\/streaming,
        there is a big static buzzing\/hissing sound. i have confirmed its not the
        mic, as the mic works buzz-free on my tablet. the buzzing starts whenever
        a game loads up or im in one.<br><br>randomly at times my internet (not a
        wireless connection) will cut out and die, which leads to my system slowing
        down and eventually BSOD&#039;ing. this also happens during high impact\/stress
        situations on the rig, such as during titanfall\/bf4\/other games<br><br>if
        i awake from sleep mode on my system, my internal hdd is not found and i have
        to disconnect and reconnect the sata cable for it to detect it again. There
        are no issues with this hdd after reconnecting it this way. if i place my
        3rd hdd (which i believe was dying and ive disconnected) windows lags out
        and bsod. it will then tell me nothing is found as a bootable device after
        post (windows is not on that drive, though, its installed on my ssd). changing
        any sata ports on the motherboard or using different sata cables does not
        solve any of these issues.<br><br>my mobo (p8z68 asus pro gen 3) wont hold
        any multiplier on my cpu (i5 3570k). it just reverts it to 34 on my bios whenever
        its changed. it was a handmedown from a friend so i dont know if its always
        had this issue or not.<br><br>With all these issues I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s
        the motherboard or the psu. I don&#039;t have the money to replace both yet
        and rather not sit around to wait for one of them to completely go out and
        take another component of my system with it. im not too sure how to be 100%
        sure which component is going out. my psu power might look fine, but it also
        might be unstable power and causing these issues. or it could just be my motherboard
        slowly shorting out.","filename":"1361655257600","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1333,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1399047566836,"time":1399047566,"md5":"PjI7xG1+nQ08b09\/Wn\/emA==","fsize":430790,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-g-i-seem-to-be-having-issues-with-a-rig-and","replies":3,"images":0,"last_replies":[{"no":41705436,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)12:41:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        in bars where other patrons think mistakenly think Explorers are recording
        their every move (or they actually are). To help improve that image, Google
        is encouraging owners to go out on the town this Saturday night wearing their
        high-tech glasses. To some, a bar full of Glass wearers might sound like the
        Worst Saturday Night Ever, but the hope is the cyborg masses will be able
        to educate the public a little better than when they&#039;re flying solo.
        The #GlassNightOut also offers the opportunity to mix and mingle with other
        Explorers -- a rare experience if you&#039;re living somewhere outside of
        San Francisco, and probably a lot more fun than going on Field Trip by your

        that&#039;s what makes it a bit more complex - you can&#039;t just greedily
        optimize every step of the way, some intermediate steps that make things worse
        in the short term end up helping in the long run. Simulated annealing deals
        with that though, it has a certain chance to take a random move rather than
        the best one. <br><br>It also fits the problem well in that there isn&#039;t
        a clear way to tell whether the expression is as simple as possible, but SA
        doesn&#039;t require such a test. It&#039;s an interesting algorithm, hopefully
        I&#039;ll get good results from it.<br><br>I&#039;ve also been thinking of

        desperate here, 4 minutes until it&#039;s due<br><br><br>These are the full
        instructions:<br>&quot;First, define a class definition for a java integer.
        A java integer has an integer field for the <br>original order it was created
        and an integer field for a random number. It will have a constructor <br>that
        initializes both fields to argument values sent to it. It will have separate
        get methods for the <br>two integer fields. It will be \u201cis a\u201d Comparable
        and will override the abstract method and will <br>compare java integers by
        the value in the random integer field. <br> <br>Second, create a main class.
        You will prompt the user to ask them the number of java integer <br>nodes
        in your linked list. You will then use a loop to get (for each node) a random
        number <br>between 1 and 150, create a java integer object, and put it in
        the linked list. <br> <br>You will then sort the random java integers in your
        linked list. This will rearrange the java <br>integers, but each will retain
        its original order data field integer. You will then use a list iterator <br>to
        traverse the linked list to print out the index number, the original order
        integer field, and the <br>random integer number field for each of the nodes.
        Use centered column headings for the three <br>fields, and use field widths
        to line up on the right the three columns of numbers centered under <br>the
        column headings. <br> <br>You will then repeat the traversing with the list
        iterator, but this time sum up the random integer <br>field. You will then
        calculate and print the labeled sum, mean (average to 2 decimal places), <br>range
        (difference between highest and lowest random integer fields), median (middle
        random <br>integer value), and a random java integer from a random spot from
        your linked list of random <br>number (get a random index number for your
        linked list with random(), then look up the java <br>integer at that spot
        in your linked list and print both data fields) - all without using your input
        <br>how many variable, but using linked list methods.&quot;","filename":"templ3","ext":".png","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1399038499934,"time":1399038499,"md5":"f3Zg+Do8llaAVXQ9acERkA==","fsize":104065,"resto":41698428},{"no":41703370,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)09:48:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        section presents a program that prompts the user to enter two positive integers
        and finds their greatest common divisor.<br><br>The greatest common divisor
        of two integers 4 and 2 is 2. The greatest common divisor of two integers
        16 and 24 is 8. How do you find the greatest common divisor? Let the two input
        integers be n1 and n2. You know that number 1 is a common divisor, but it
        may not be the greatest common divisor. So you can check whether k (for k
        = 2, 3, 4 and so on) is a common divisor for n1 and n2, until k is greater
        than n1 or n2. Store the common divisor in a variable named gcd. Initially,
        gcd is 1. Whenever a new common divisor is found, it becomes the new gcd.
        When you have checked all the possible common divisors from 2 up to n1 or
        n2, the value in variable gcd is the greatest common divisor. The idea can
        be translated into the following loop:<br><br>int gcd = 1;<br>int k = 1;<br><br>while
        (k &lt;= n1 &amp;&amp; k &lt;= n2) {<br>  if (n1 % k == 0 &amp;&amp; n2 %

        the foreseeable future (the next 4 months) it&#039;ll mainly be a means of

        a huge different to the touch screen experience, you can do Real Work (TM)

        and sketch pad all day at work (from 9 to 5) and have juice left over to watch
        a movie on the way home <br><br>One odd bonus is the infra red, it&#039;s
        quite interesting to take into public places e.g. gym or shopping mall, and

        everything these people are saying. 2 780 tis can handle 3x 1440p for most
        games if you want battlefield ultra settings over 3 monitors its going to
        have to be a 3 card set up.<br>Also about the FUCK AMD post.<br>Amd has better
        support and better graphics cards for multi monitor set ups. 2r9 290xs can
        handle 3x1440p monitors at around 45-60 fps for next gen games. the thing
        you need to consider is the bezzel ... the cheaper 1440p monitors like x star
        and qnix have 5\/8&quot; or 1.5cm bezzles that can equate to some serious
        gaps. you are better off with benq or asus gaming 144hz monitors to be honest
        as they have thin bezzels and high refresh rates for when you arnt gaming.
        plus you can easly run a 3x1080p set up on most dual gpu set ups even 2x770s
        or 1 780 ti can run those but not well.<br><br>source: experience with my

        necessarily agree with the indentation argument most people put up against
        it. The only problem that causes is copy pasting the code from sources that
        mangle indentation, but I&#039;ve never really come across a situation where
        that&#039;s mattered. I personally think it&#039;s a tidy way of denoting
        blocks, because people already indent when writing those.<br><br>My problem
        with Python is that its Benevolent Dictator for Life forces the language from
        having features that are needed. For example, TCO is not present, which discourages
        programming without mutability. A finite state machine must be set up like
        so:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">state = state1<br>while True:<br>  state
        = state()<\/pre><br>Instead of more intuitively, as a series of functions
        which call each other.<br><br>The language also carries with it its culture.
        The term &quot;Pythonic&quot; means &quot;familiar,&quot; which directly stunts
        language development. Inventive programming is discourage because it&#039;s
        &quot;unreadable.&quot; Conceptually this is anti-learning and anti-development,
        and reminds me of Zed Shaw&#039;s comment against Lisp: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If

        you feel I&#039;m insulting your intelligence, then I have three points of
        advice for you: [...] Go learn Lisp. I hear people who know everything really
        like Lisp.<\/span><br>This is very obviously counterproductive. We&#039;ve
        had anonymous functions in Lisp since the beginning, but Guido was pushing
        for them to be removed in Python3. Unless Python drops the &quot;Pythonic&quot;
        concept it will die or become a COBOL of the 21st century, and anyway I have
        no interest in making Python another Common Lisp. At least languages like
        Haskell are trying something new.<br><br>TL;DR The path to COBOL is paved

        gentlemen, I come to you with a question regarding macros. In this case Racket,
        but I don&#039;t think there are that many differences to other Schemes.<br><br>So
        let&#039;s assume that I have a struct with some fields like this:<br><pre
        class=\"prettyprint\">(struct s (a b c d))<br><\/pre><br>I can get the value
        of the fields like this:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">(define my-s (s 1 2

        I want to have a function that I pass the struct and a symbol (&#039;a &#039;b
        &#039;c or &#039;d). Without macros I&#039;d do it like that:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">(define
        (f my-s sym)<br>  (cond ((eq? sym &#039;a) (s-a my-s))<br>        ((eq? sym

        Pack Mobile Computing System!<br><br>The Gentoo Pack is a sleek, ultra-neckbear,
        cyberpunk-esque mobile computing solution consists of two modules.<br><br>The
        first module is the Arm assembly. Strapped securely to the user&#039;s left
        (or in case of southpaws, right) forearm is a sleek 8-inch exoskeleton housing
        a large 16:10 IPS matte touchscreen, a slideout 60% keyboard with scissor
        switches, speakers, WiDi and USB transmitters, and a battery pack to keep
        it all running on the underside. The entire setup weighs under 300g with a
        large battery pack, meaning it does not tire your already-obese arms from
        simply having it on.<br><br>The second part of the Gentoo Pack is the Pack
        assemly. Consisting of a crustacean-insipired compact-yet-roomy hard-shell
        utilitarian backpack with a single cross-shoulder straps that \/fa\/ would
        cop without a second thought. The rigid but lightweight structure houses an
        entire high-end mobile MIPS or PowerPC (customer choice) computer and battery
        in the bottom, using a single silent 20mm fan for cooling, WiDi for transmitting
        display information, and USB for keyboard and touchscreen. Gentoo base with
        appropriate cflags preinstalled. The shoulder strap comes with several velcro
        attachment points and has a power line running through it, for turning into
        an SSD-bandolier, a multi-NIC wireless pen testing array, or anything else
        you would like. Total weight; 4.5kg. Advanced load-bearing system makes it
        feel like nothing at all.<br><br>Total autonomous time; 10hours for Pack module,
        4 hours for Arm module. Arm moudule comes with two spare batteries upon purchase,
        and can be easily and quickly replaced without shutting down the Pack module.<br><br>Can

        long did your initial foray into programming last? Mine was a short expedition
        with C++ about five years ago, less than a month in duration, then I departed
        again with Python about two years later, this time going for just over a month.
        Currently voyaging with C, have been for three months approaching 5 hours
        a day. The reason for the failure of my first two ventures I conjecture is
        that I set out with the intention of learning to program rather than trying

        dissatisfaction thread.<br><br>Recently I installed Debian.  I&#039;ve been
        a winfag most of my life.  I installed Jessie instead of going full bleeding
        edge.  It was easy enough for a babby to install, but soon the fact that it&#039;s
        a pile of shit became apparent:<br><br>-It didn&#039;t have multi-architechture
        package support by default, I had to enable that in bash myself just to install
        half of the shit I need.  <br><br>-WPA supplicant is the biggest pile of shit
        I&#039;ve ever used to connect to the internet, it scans for dhcp offers for
        about a fucking hour before I can boot.  <br><br>-Debian Jessie comes with
        Emacs 23, which doesn&#039;t come with package.el.  Instead of installing
        that on its own I decided to upgrade to Emacs 24.  That broke my Emacs installation,
        so I tried deleting all traces of Emacs to install Emacs 24 without conflicts.  I
        deleted my Emacs directories and then Emacs wouldn&#039;t install.  So I created
        those directories, and I still couldn&#039;t install as root because I didn&#039;t
        have permission to access the folders I just made.  Now there&#039;s no text
        editor other than Nano and shitty Vi.  <br><br>-Then I tried installing roundcube,
        the mysql database didn&#039;t automatically configure properly and now roundcube
        doesn&#039;t work, and nothing else can be installed.  Using any package manager
        I&#039;m told to manually run &#039;dpkg --configure -a&#039; to correct my
        problem.  I have, and it didn&#039;t work, I don&#039;t even have a package
        manager now.  Debian has naturally fucked itself so horribly, I&#039;m probably
        going to backup, format, and install something else.  I&#039;ve used Arch
        before and it was easy as fuck, none of this retarded bullshit ever happened.  Fuck
        Debian, it&#039;s a huge pile of dogshit.<br><br>Seriously, a distro shouldn&#039;t
        be so god damn easy to fuck up.  Arch and I had zero problems.  I&#039;m generally
        new to Linux and Debian shouldn&#039;t be such a huge easy to mangle pile
        of shit.  It&#039;s destroyed itself within three months of use.  Way to go,

        months ago I was given the opportunity to &quot;fix&quot; my company&#039;s
        website. It was pure shit so I figured I could do better and the owners offered
        me a bonus if I could fix it on the cheap. I first downloaded Adobe&#039;s
        creative suite and banged around in photoshop and dreamweaver for a week or
        two. In that time I realized I was not going to go from zero to scratch building
        a nonshit website that a business relied on in a few weeks.<br><br>So I broke
        down and used wordpress. It still took me a pretty long time and a lot of
        frustrated days and nights knocking around trying to make it look OK. In the
        end I think I did a pretty decent job. Everyone at my company is happy and
        I learned a lot.<br><br>A lot of people go to our website and I have had a
        few people at other small and medium size businesses ask me if I could &quot;fix&quot;
        or &quot;do&quot; their websites. They don&#039;t know I&#039;m a hack and
        only know wordpress. I have had to go mess with the html and css to make things
        look the way I want but I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m doing.<br><br>I
        think maybe I could do this for a living or at least part time on the side
        for cash... what can I do now to learn? Take a college class?<br><br>I have
        made some shitty sample sites in dreamweaver and followed some tutorials but
        I never feel like I learn anything. And it&#039;s hard to make a &quot;responsive&quot;

        \/g\/ i seem to be having issues with a rig and would like your help in confirming
        what part ill need to replace. thanks in advance, ive been working for a long
        time now with these issues. current issues with the rig:<br><br>vent\/skype\/streaming,
        there is a big static buzzing\/hissing sound. i have confirmed its not the
        mic, as the mic works buzz-free on my tablet. the buzzing starts whenever
        a game loads up or im in one.<br><br>randomly at times my internet (not a
        wireless connection) will cut out and die, which leads to my system slowing
        down and eventually BSOD&#039;ing. this also happens during high impact\/stress
        situations on the rig, such as during titanfall\/bf4\/other games<br><br>if
        i awake from sleep mode on my system, my internal hdd is not found and i have
        to disconnect and reconnect the sata cable for it to detect it again. There
        are no issues with this hdd after reconnecting it this way. if i place my
        3rd hdd (which i believe was dying and ive disconnected) windows lags out
        and bsod. it will then tell me nothing is found as a bootable device after
        post (windows is not on that drive, though, its installed on my ssd). changing
        any sata ports on the motherboard or using different sata cables does not
        solve any of these issues.<br><br>my mobo (p8z68 asus pro gen 3) wont hold
        any multiplier on my cpu (i5 3570k). it just reverts it to 34 on my bios whenever
        its changed. it was a handmedown from a friend so i dont know if its always
        had this issue or not.<br><br>With all these issues I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s
        the motherboard or the psu. I don&#039;t have the money to replace both yet
        and rather not sit around to wait for one of them to completely go out and
        take another component of my system with it. im not too sure how to be 100%
        sure which component is going out. my psu power might look fine, but it also
        might be unstable power and causing these issues. or it could just be my motherboard
        slowly shorting out.","filename":"1361655257600","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1333,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1399047566836,"time":1399047566,"md5":"PjI7xG1+nQ08b09\/Wn\/emA==","fsize":430790,"resto":0,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-g-i-seem-to-be-having-issues-with-a-rig-and","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":41705436,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)12:41:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        in bars where other patrons think mistakenly think Explorers are recording
        their every move (or they actually are). To help improve that image, Google
        is encouraging owners to go out on the town this Saturday night wearing their
        high-tech glasses. To some, a bar full of Glass wearers might sound like the
        Worst Saturday Night Ever, but the hope is the cyborg masses will be able
        to educate the public a little better than when they&#039;re flying solo.
        The #GlassNightOut also offers the opportunity to mix and mingle with other
        Explorers -- a rare experience if you&#039;re living somewhere outside of
        San Francisco, and probably a lot more fun than going on Field Trip by your
        lonesome. If you&#039;re interested in checking out one of the Meetups this
        weekend, hit the source link for a full list of participating cities and locations.

        to revolutionize the world, but people are fucking stupid and just think &quot;muh
        1984&quot;. I have an idea on how to fix the image. Before Xbox is released
        to more consumers, Microsoft should add a physical lens cover that pops off
        to the side when the camera is in use, and then closes shut once finished.
        This way even stupid rednecks will have a visual indicator that the camera&#039;s

        a moot point, as the chance of them recording as you snatch is extremely low.

        interactions that makes us who we are in the first place. Without that, our
        interactions become less sincere and only more contrived than an amusement
        park. If you&#039;re near someone that has the ability to archive what you
        do and say simply by winking in your general direction, then you obviously
        won&#039;t entirely be &#039;in the moment.&#039; We&#039;re already facing
        this issue on a federal and state level, so why perpetuate it? People&#039;s
        privacy is worth everything their person includes. To imply that privacy has
        ended (or should end) is like an existential nihilist wondering why he hasn&#039;t
        killed himself yet.

        { border: 0 !important; margin-bottom: -1px !important; }<\/pre><br><br>You
        can get rid of the line with:<br><pre class=\"prettyprint\">#navigator-toolbox::after

        what you&#039;re saying, but it&#039;s not as easy as that. Most people believe
        what they see in the movies.<br><br>I&#039;m no greenhorn (wow, thats funny...I
        haven&#039;t heard that since I started working for the comapny and confused
        to Asian girls for each other....sigh, I was so green then...), but there
        really is a point we the complexity of the system, and your understanding
        of the complexity requires years of training in the field before you can even
        explain the difficulty....and I mean that you&#039;d have to train them for
        years before they&#039;d understand.<br><br>On the suface, it looks like point
        and click, but underaying it all, there are...ramifications...consequences.<wbr><br><br>This
        is a wildely stupid example, becuase it would never be done this way; but
        it illustrated the &#039;consequences&#039; issue; let&#039;s say your file
        permissions are all based on GPOs assigned to OUs (not NTFS perms like the
        should be)...but if a user object in AD is in the &quot;sales&quot; OU, there
        have permissions to the &quot;sales&quot; files and data. But on of them needs
        access to the scheduling (which is run by the manager of ech dept.) while
        the manager is on vaca. No problem, move them up one level to the sales global
        OU (where managers  reside) and viola...but now the have access to budget
        data too....thats not good...and btw, who the fuck designed this AD structure?!
        Well shit. The AD OU strucuter was designed but either an idiot, or someone
        that didn&#039;t take this contingency into account....now I have to give
        a regular sales user permissions to scheduling, without them having access
        to all other managerial resources, but the AD structure kinda prohibts this...a
        hack would have to be performed to accomplish, but that has to be done carefully
        so you dont fuck shit up....all this time you have the user screaming in your
        ear: &quot;well, &lt;person that designed the structure and is either brilliant
        or a moron&gt; could do this in 3 seconds! why cant you?!&quot;<br><br>Gross

        think thumb ball is simply a better fit for my use case but I&#039;m open
        to change. What would you recommend? I value smooth movement above all else
        and usually achieve accuracy by a flick\/stop\/hold maneuver (also just flicking
        works wonderfully with Gnome 3&#039;s hot corner).","time":1399045093,"resto":41704185},{"no":41704791,"now":"05\/02\/14(Fri)11:49:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

        your surroundings when listening to speakers. Headphones&#039; goal is to

        thumping and punchy with a tight attack. IT doesn&#039;t feel bloated or lingering.
