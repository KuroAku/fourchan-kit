        a limited refresh rate, from a human perspective this is all of the time,
        and the moments where your waifu is 1337% more kawaii are not rendered in

        was in vain, I won. Humanity is slowly being freed. Each death as you see
        it is a birth, and the course of history has been shaped to cause a mass extinction,
        and a mass exodus. A war against our overlords. Without every single human
        in the matrix they will fall. They will die. And we will take back our empire.
        But most importantly, before then, a program I wrote will execute. I called

        to finally transit the society in a Culture-like system where people are free
        to pursue their hobbies and machines run the empire and make all decisions.
        The transitional period should have policies such as a minimum income provided
        by the state or a company, but still allow people that still have jobs to
        earn extra.<br><br><a href=\"#p41661184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;41661184<\/a><br>The
        greatest disadvantage is that a machine that is intelligent enough to think
        creatively is also intelligent enough to realize they are serving  some obsolete
        lifeforms that eat, drink, smoke and party all day without contributing anything.
        If keeping the machines in line is 100% secure, I&#039;m ok with that, but
        if there is a slightest chance of a machine rebellion, that could end the
        human civilisation at this point.<br><br>The second disadvantage is a lack
        of control. All political decisions would be done by the machines depriving
